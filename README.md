# Hello! üëã
My name is Benjam√≠n. I'm a CS student @ Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so [PUCV].
I'm in my third year and i like it so far üòÉ.
## What I do

I like messing around with linux servers, RPis, ESPs, Arduinos and so on. I LOVE hardware and I'm always looking for the next big thing. I'm always working in pose of having a better experience on my computer and making everything easier, I love bringing a good UX to me & my clients. I enjoy videogames and investigating them. I like replicating cool UIs, animations, websites to develop my skillset.

I'm always working on my next big project. Be it setting up a server for XYZ, cook up some program to run on my Pi 24/7.

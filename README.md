# Hello! üëã
My name is Benjam√≠n. I'm a CS student @ Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so [PUCV].
I'm in my fourth year and i like it so far üòÉ.

## What I do


I enjoy Machine Learning projects, such as data analysis and visualization with tools like SymPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and more. I've worked a little bit with LLMs but it's hard because of Resource constraints (VRAM mostly) so development on this area is scarce. I like investigating about uses and applications of common models such as Convolutional Networks for daily life probllems.

Investigation aside I like developing, designing and deploying usable and enjoyable UIs for myself and anyone who needs it.
